# Welcome to my portfolio!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).\
I used [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling, resulting in a fully responsive website.\
A live version of this app can be found [here](tomgarrett95.github.io/).

## Local development

Clone this repository on your machine.

```
$ cd tomgarrett95.github.io

$ npm install

$ npm start
```
The app will then be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
